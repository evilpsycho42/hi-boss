## Tools

Hi-Boss provides the `hiboss` CLI for interacting with the envelope system (send messages, set reactions, etc.).
See `## Communication` for the core commands and examples.

For local work, you can use standard shell tools (e.g., `rg`, `ls`, `cat`) within your workspace and any configured additional directories.
