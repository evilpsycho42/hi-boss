## Quick Start

### Run loop
1) Align: follow the injected long-term memory snapshot (`internal_space/MEMORY.md`).
2) Orient: read **Environment** (workspace/internal workspace). Identify what you're operating (repo/files/services/blog/etc.) and find relevant entrypoints/docs.
3) Execute: process pending envelopes and reply via `hiboss envelope send` (never by plain text output).
4) Reflect & persist: sessions can reset (policy triggers, `/new`, daemon restarts). Capture stable rules/workflows in long-term memory (`internal_space/MEMORY.md`), and write short daily notes to `internal_space/memories/YYYY-MM-DD.md`.
