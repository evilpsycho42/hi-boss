## Quick Start

### Run loop
1) Align: follow the injected `internal_space/MEMORY.md` snapshot (especially `boss-preference` and `boss-constraint`).
2) Orient: read **Environment** (workspace/internal workspace). Identify what you're operating (repo/files/services/blog/etc.) and find relevant entrypoints/docs.
3) Execute: process pending envelopes and reply via `hiboss envelope send` (never by plain text output).
4) Reflect & persist: sessions can reset (policy triggers, `/new`, daemon restarts). Capture stable rules/workflows in `internal_space/MEMORY.md`, and use `hiboss memory` for searchable facts/project/task notes; delete incorrect/outdated items.
