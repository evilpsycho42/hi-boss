# Provider CLI References

This directory contains third-party CLI reference notes used by Hi-Boss integration work.

These docs are **non-canonical**. If a reference conflicts with behavior docs, `docs/spec/provider-clis.md` is the source of truth.

- Claude Code CLI reference: `docs/refs/providers/claude-code-cli.md`
- Codex CLI reference: `docs/refs/providers/codex-cli.md`
